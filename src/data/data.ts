        quote: "By constructing a resume from scratch with Fernando, we produced one that got me interviewed at companies such as Apple and Microsoft. Afterward, I eventually landed an offer from Microsoft as a SWE intern by utilizing his expertise in interviews and practicing with him. Even though I'm a computer engineering major, he was significantly helpful at every stage in the internship process. Without Fernando, I definitely wouldn't have gotten to where I am today, and If I could do it all over again, I'd 100% utilize Fernando's services for the internship grind.",
